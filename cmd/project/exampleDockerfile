# The base image comes with many system dependencies pre-installed to help you get started quickly.
# Please refer to the base image's Dockerfile for more information before adding additional dependencies.
# IMPORTANT: The base image overrides the default huggingface cache location.

# System dependencies
# if you need additional system dependencies beyond those included in the base image, feel free to add them here
# but be aware those changes will not be reflected in the development pod
# unless you override the base image in runpod.toml to an image that includes them.
